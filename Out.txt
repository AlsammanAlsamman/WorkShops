# Diversity Analysis
Diversity analysis in crop science involves assessing and understanding the genetic diversity within a population of crops. This analysis is crucial for various reasons, including breeding programs, conservation efforts, and ensuring the resilience of crops against diseases and environmental changes. Different methods can be employed for diversity analysis, such as molecular markers, morphological traits, and agronomic characteristics.

# Diversity Analysis components


Diversity analysis can be divided into two main components: diversity indices and clustering methods. 
Diversity indices are used to measure the genetic diversity within a population. Clustering methods are used to group individuals based on their genetic similarity. 

Which includes the following:

-	**Genetic distance and similarity:** Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between two individuals. Genetic similarity is a measure of the genetic similarity between two individuals.

-	**Genetic diversity indices:** Genetic diversity indices are used to measure the genetic diversity within a population.

-	**Phenotypic diversity indices:** Phenotypic diversity indices are used to measure the phenotypic diversity within a population.

-	**Principal component analysis:** Principal component analysis is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.

-	**Population structure:** Population structure is the genetic structure of a population.

# About the dataset

In this tutorial, we will use the R programming language to perform diversity analysis on a dataset of 554 barley varieties.
The data are found in the folder "Data" and are in the VCF format and Hapmap format with the following names "Barley.vcf" and "Barley.hmp" respectively.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# set working directory
setwd("/home/samman/Documents/MyGitHub/WorkShops")
```

# About the R script
The R script for this tutorial is free to use and can be downloaded from the following link: 

We need to install the following packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(SNPRelate)
# SNPrelate is an R package for relating and comparing large SNP datasets

library(gdsfmt)
# gdsfmt is an R package for working with GDS files

library(SeqArray)
# SeqArray is an R package for working with VCF files

library(dplyr)
# dplyr is an R package for working with data frames

library(ggplot2)
# ggplot2 is an R package for data visualization

library(LEA)
# LEA is an R package for estimating the population structure of a population

library(parallel)
# parallel is an R package for parallel computing

library(vcfR)
# vcfR is an R package for working with VCF files

```
